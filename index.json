In addition to cleanroom testing I also process samples into the cleanroom and incubate tests once they have come out of the cleanroom.\nAs a Formulation Team Lead I delegated tasks to team members in the chemical hood, on the pipetteing line, and other stations. I problem-solve on the fly while dealing with people. For example, a formulator could tell me a biological contaminant is present while an alarm goes off. All of this needs to be handled in a timely and professional manner. Additionally, I formulate buffers in conicles, several-liter formulations, and 200-liter drums.\nDuring college and the first year or so after graduation, I worked in outdoor recreation and ecology for four consecutive years. During the course of this work, I have become competent at operating various tools used in various branches of outdoor management. When I worked for Draper City and did my internship with AmeriCorps I expanded this skill set in the application of ecological restoration and noxious weed management.\nMy passion for ecology, the environment, and the interdisciplinary sciences that are essential to understanding the world around us drew me to pursue hands-on courses and independent studies during the course of my undergraduate education. In these courses, I have worked in a lab collecting data, analyzing findings, and presenting the results in poster and presentation format. I have used YSI meters, done stream gauging, well tests, and soil tests, and used various water quality testing kits.\nAs an activist, I have attended many trainings on grassroots organizations. I have presented to my college\u0026rsquo;s CFO and board members, presented to City Common Councils and Town Boards, built school gardens, organized and participated in three Earth Day events, and helped the City of Plattsburgh begin the process of signing onto state programs through NYSERDA. I did these things in collaboration with other activists and organizations.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ef0925c9c53a4cf73a1b3ef0e120ab9c","permalink":"https://malldred.github.io/author/alexandria-elliott/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/alexandria-elliott/","section":"authors","summary":"In my new role in Sterility Assurance I use the aseptic technique in a controlled cleanroom to test medical devices to determine if they are sterile.

Living shorelines that incorporate salt marshes and oyster reefs have been shown to improve water quality by removing excess nutrients and protecting coasts from storm surges, but adaptive and continual management is essential. Positive and negative species interactions may influence the success of these shoreline projects. Here we synthesize the results of a multi-year study of the Sherman Creek Living Shoreline in New York City, NY. We conducted studies of shoreline habitat types pre- (2019) and post- restoration (2020), following a mussel-addition experiment (2021), and following the implementation of enhanced goose-exclusion techniques (2023). In each year, we collected sediment cores from shoreline habitat types (mudflat, rip-rap, existing marsh, new marsh) and performed continuous-flow incubations to quantify dissolved gas and nutrient fluxes, with the goal of comparing rates of nitrogen removal among habitat types. We also assessed above- and below-ground biomass and sediment characteristics of each habitat. Though sediment organic content in the existing marsh was more than double that of any other habitat type, we found similar rates of nitrogen removal via denitrification in the existing and newly restored marsh. Adding mussels to the marsh plants increased rates of nitrogen removal by 50%. Post goose-exclusion, we saw plant growth like that of the existing marsh, showing that managing species interactions can have a positive effect on the benefits provided by living shorelines.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Species interactions critical to restoration success in an urban living shoreline","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Description Patterns of chloride contamination illustrate the impact of human activities on the Lake Champlain Basin.

As a result, all food web models require some unavoidable simplifications because of limited data availability, whether temporally, spatially, or taxonomically. Large databases of published trophic interactions have made this process somewhat easier, but knowledge gaps persist. We combine the use of databases with extensive field surveys, including gut-content analysis, to generate a food web for Lake George, NY. Including aquatic plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish, our analysis identified 279 genera in the lake involved in 1910 interactions. After removing genera with no identified interactions or improbable interactions and grouping some genera into higher categories, the food web included 49 nodes with 484 interactions among them. The network structure of the inferred Lake George food web exhibits several common patterns such as relatively few trophic levels and the prevalence of tritrophic chains. Our results suggest that constructing food webs from databases provides a useful first step to determine topology. However, in situ sampling allowed us to account for additional interactions, as only 50 of the 106 directly observed interactions between fish and their prey were also found in published databases. Finally, we highlight the need to focus on developing a better understanding of herbivory in lakes, as species interactions among the diverse plankton and macroinvertebrate populations are not well known.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Putting a lake together: Integrating synthetic data and field observations to build a better food web","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Whaley","Mary Alldred"],"categories":null,"content":"Featured art by Dr. Jonathan Borrelli.

It is also foundational to wetland ecosystems along the Atlantic coast of North America. *Spartina* plantings play an essential role in marsh reconstruction projects, and *Geukensia* is rapidly gaining popularity as a tool in coastal restoration to help marshes resist erosion and to remove nutrient pollution. However, it remains unclear whether positive effects documented primarily in natural settings will translate to urban and constructed estuaries where they are most needed. Using systematic review and meta-analysis, we compared the influence of the *Spartina*-*Geukensia* mutualism on growth of the species and on nitrogen-cycling processes. Our review suggests the potential for context dependence in this mutualism, with substantial implications for coastal marsh resilience and restoration. Notably, the positive effect of the species on the growth of their mutualist found in natural marshes was absent in constructed marshes and negative in urban marshes. Encouragingly, the effect of each species on nitrogen cycling was similar regardless of context. We found that this mutualism remains severely understudied in urban and constructed marshes, and we suggest future directions to address the knowledge gaps identified in our analysis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A meta-analysis reveals knowledge gaps in our understanding of the *Spartina*-*Geukensia* mutualism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed T.

However, different responses of these species to sea-level rise and eutrophication can cause mussel beds to persist in areas where cordgrass has been lost to erosion and excessive tidal inundation. The function of these remnant mussel beds, in the absence of cordgrass mutualists, remains unclear. In this study, we sampled an eroding salt marsh in Jamaica Bay (NY, USA) to determine mussel density and size in non-vegetated mussel beds and vegetated marsh. We also collected sediment cores from remnant mussel beds and adjacent mudflats (i.e., former marsh) and performed continuous-flow core incubations to measure benthic nutrient fluxes, sediment oxygen demand, and denitrification. We found that remnant mussel beds were dominated by larger mussels compared to vegetated beds, which suggests less recruitment to remnant beds. In contrast to previous studies, which have found positive effects of mussels on denitrification, we found similar rates in mussel beds and mudflats. Sediment oxygen demand was also higher in remnant mussel beds suggesting that sediments may become more reduced due to mussel respiration. Our study suggests that the presence of mussels does not enhance, and may inhibit, nitrogen removal in eroded marsh sediments.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Loss of salt marsh plants impacts ribbed mussel (*Geukensia demissa*) size, density, and influence on sediment nitrogen cycling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan Morris","Mary Alldred","Chester Zarnoch","S.

The sediments in these systems harbor diverse and complex bacterial communities possessing metabolic capacities that provide ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and removal. On the East Coast of the USA, salt marshes have been experiencing degradation due to anthropogenic stressors. Salt marsh islands within Jamaica Bay, New York City (USA), are surrounded by a large highly urbanized watershed and have declined in area. Restoration efforts have been enacted to reduce further loss, but little is known about how microbial communities develop following restoration activities, or how processes such as nitrogen cycling are impacted. Sediment samples were collected at two sampling depths from five salt marsh islands to characterize the bacterial communities found in marsh sediment including a post-restoration chronosequence of 3–12 years. We used 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing to define alpha and beta diversity, taxonomic composition, and predicted metabolic profile of each sediment sample. We found significant differences in alpha diversity between sampling depths, and significant differences in beta diversity, taxonomic composition, and predicted metabolic capacity among the five sampling locations. The youngest restored site and the degraded natural sampling site exhibited the most distinct communities among the five sites. Our findings suggest that while the salt marsh islands are located in close proximity to each other, they harbor distinct bacterial communities that can be correlated with post-restoration age, marsh health, and other environmental factors such as availability of organic carbon.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Estuarine sediment microbiomes from a chronosequence of restored urban salt marshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Description The relationship between ribbed mussels Geukensia demisssa and smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora is a classic example of a mutualism.

My work has addressed this challenge at multiple scales using such approaches as literature synthesis, field surveys, field manipulations, and smaller scale experiments. In a meta-analysis of 419 published measurements of denitrification, I estimated that vegetation on average increases the ability of marshes to remove nitrogen by 55% and that this effect differs among species. I pursued two field projects to explain variation among species by investigating interactions among plant traits and sediment properties and processes. In the first, I determined that removing an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, increased sediment nitrogen concentrations and decreased denitrification relative to marshes containing either invasive Phragmites or native cattail species. These results suggest a trade-off between removing invasive species to conserve biodiversity and managing wetlands to promote nitrogen removal. The second project addressed interactions between belowground traits of common salt marsh dominant Spartina alterniflora and ecosystem properties and processes along a land-use gradient on Long Island, NY. Root growth of S. alterniflora responded positively to salinity and negatively to nitrogen availability, suggesting that eutrophication and sea-level rise may have opposing effects on root mass, and therefore marsh stability, in the future. Preliminary results from Long Island field surveys further suggest that S. alterniflora roots influence nitrification and denitrification rates by introducing oxygen to sediments, providing further evidence that plants alter key nitrogen transformation processes and influence the ability of wetlands to remove nitrogen. These projects represent an effort to solve pressing management problems using ecological theory from several ecological sub-disciplines at multiple scales.\nYou read more about these projects in Publications.\nCollaborators Stephen B.

Epibenthic jellyfish are ideal organisms for studying this phenomenon due to their sessile lifestyle, broad geographic distribution, and prevalence in near-shore coastal environments. There are few studies, however, that have documented epibenthic jellyfish abundance and measured their impact on ecological processes in tropical ecosystems. In this study, the density and size of the upside-down jellyfish (*Cassiopea* spp.) were measured in Codrington Lagoon, Barbuda. A sediment core incubation study, with and without *Cassiopea*, also was performed to determine their impact on benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes. Densities of *Cassiopea* were 24–168 m^−2^, among the highest reported values in the literature. Under illuminated conditions, *Cassiopea* increased oxygen production \u003e300% compared to sediment alone, and they changed sediments from net heterotrophy to net autotrophy. *Cassiopea* increased benthic ammonium uptake, but reduced nitrate uptake, suggesting they can significantly alter nitrogen cycling. Future studies should quantify the abundance of *Cassiopea* and measure their impacts on ecosystem processes, in order to further determine how anthropogenic-related changes may be altering the function of tropical coastal ecosystems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Size and density of upside-down jellyfish, *Cassiopea* sp., and their impact on benthic fluxes in a Caribbean lagoon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Alldred","Jonathan J.

Accumulation of hydrogen sulfide in sediments may accelerate rates of marsh loss in eutrophic estuaries and is likely driven by complex feedbacks between wetland plant growth and microbial redox reactions. We used a chronosequence of restored marshes in urbanized and eutrophic Jamaica Bay (New York City, USA) to assess how sediment redox conditions change among seasons and over the lifetime of restored marshes. We also compared a stable extant marsh to one that has deteriorated over the past 50 years. We collected seasonal sediment cores from each marsh, and used a motorized microprofiling system to measure the vertical distribution of oxygen and sulfide. We fit a logistic function to each profile to estimate (1) maximum concentrations, (2) rates of increase/decline, and (3) depths of maximum increase/decline. We quantified sediment density, porosity, organic content, and belowground plant biomass, and estimated differences in daily tidal inundation among sites using water-level loggers. We found that minimum oxygen and maximum sulfide concentrations occur during summer. Sulfide concentrations were highest in sites that experienced the longest daily tidal inundation, including the degraded extant marsh and the oldest restored marsh. Spatial patterns in oxygen and sulfide were related to belowground plant biomass, supporting our hypothesis that root growth increases sediment oxygen and partially alleviates sulfide stress. Our data support the growing body of evidence that belowground plant growth may enhance the resilience of marshes to sea-level rise by increasing marsh elevation and facilitating oxygen diffusion into marsh sediments.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Marsh plants enhance coastal marsh resilience by changing sediment oxygen and sulfide concentrations in an urban, eutrophic estuary","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Zhu","Chester Zarnoch","J.

Restoration projects address marsh loss, yet it remains unclear how well restored marshes grow, expand, and function in eutrophic waters. Here, we explored how a facultative mutualism between Atlantic ribbed mussels *Geukensia demissa* and cordgrass *Spartina alterniflora* may enhance marsh growth and nitrogen cycling in a eutrophic setting. We created experimental plots in Jamaica Bay, NY, that contained live mussels, mussel shells, or no mussels (control). After 9 wk, we measured sediment and plant characteristics. We also collected sediment cores for use in continuous flow-through incubations with ambient site water and water enriched with stable isotope-labeled nitrate (^15^NO_~3~^-^). Denitrification in marsh plots with live mussels was significantly higher than the other treatments. Live mussels likely enhanced denitrification as biodeposits increased sediment organic carbon and anaerobic conditions. Mussel treatments did not impact cordgrass growth, possibly due to the eutrophic conditions of our study system or the duration of our trials. Ribbed mussels may be a valuable addition for salt marsh restoration projects in eutrophic estuaries since they increase the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal. Future work should focus on long-term effects of ribbed mussels on nitrogen removal and cordgrass biomass in restored marshes to determine how the mutualism impacts restoration success as sites age.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Ribbed mussels *Geukensia demissa* enhance nitrogen-removal services but not plant growth in restored eutrophic salt marshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Quantifying the effects of nutrient loading on belowground plant growth is an ongoing controversy in wetland research, with previous experiments demonstrating both positive and negative impacts. Moreover, salinity may also decrease belowground growth through sulfide toxicity, or plants may increase root growth to oxidize sediments and respond to sulfide stress. Because salinity influences plant nitrogen assimilation and sediment nitrogen retention, salinity and nitrogen may interact to influence belowground plant growth. We sampled an urban‐to‐rural land‐use gradient of 11 *Spartina alterniflora* marshes on Long Island, New York, to look for correlates of belowground biomass. We found that belowground biomass was related positively to salinity and negatively to extractable nitrogen content in sediments. Total belowground plant biomass was reduced by 60–70% in high‐nitrogen marshes and enhanced by as much as 70% in high‐salinity marshes. Further, we found no evidence of interaction between salinity and nitrogen, indicating that these factors were independently related to belowground plant growth. Our results indicate that chronic eutrophication and increasing salinity resulting from sea‐level rise are likely to have opposing effects on future marsh stability.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Impact of salinity and nutrients on salt marsh stability","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"9ef178e085e53b424edbedf3f0e69865","permalink":"https://malldred.github.io/templates/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/external-project/","section":"templates","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"templates"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Removal of invasive plant species to conserve native diversity is a common management objective in many ecosystems, including wetlands. However, substantial changes in plant community composition have the potential to alter sediment characteristics and ecosystem services, including permanent removal of nitrogen from these systems via microbial denitrification. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping and removing invasive plants is needed to manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets. We monitored small-scale removals of *Phragmites australis* over four years to determine their effects on potential denitrification rates relative to three untreated *Phragmites* sites and adjacent sites dominated by native *Typha angustifolia*. Sediment ammonium increased following the removal of vegetation from treated sites, likely as a result of decreases in both plant uptake and nitrification. Denitrification potentials were lower in removal sites relative to untreated *Phragmites* sites, a pattern that persisted at least two years following removal as native plant species began to re-colonize treated sites. These results suggest the potential for a trade-off between invasive-plant management and nitrogen-removal services. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping versus removing invasive plants is needed to adequately manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Effects of invasive-plant management on nitrogen-removal services in freshwater tidal marshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Alldred","Stephen B.

Predicting impacts of these changes on ecosystem services such as denitrification, a process that mitigates the consequences of nitrogen pollution, remains one of the most important challenges facing ecologists. Wetlands especially are valued as important sites of denitrification, and wetland plants are expected to have differing effects on denitrification. We present the results of a meta‐analysis, conducted on 419 published estimates of denitrification in wetlands dominated by different plant species. Plants increased denitrification rates by 55% on average. This effect varied significantly among communities as defined by the dominant plant species, but surprisingly did not differ substantially among methods for measuring denitrification or among types of wetlands. We conclude that mechanistically linking functional plant traits to denitrification will be key to predicting the role of wetlands in nitrogen mitigation in a changing world.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Effects of wetland plants on denitrification rates: a meta‐analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Alldred","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
