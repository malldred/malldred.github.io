With my Bachelors of Environmental Science, I became increasingly devoted to sustainable recreation management, and justice, equity, and inclusion in the outdoors. Some of my most formative moments have been spent in parks and protected areas, and it’s both a passion and a goal of mine to help foster those same experiences for marginalized groups in the outdoors. I think parks and protected areas host a unique opportunity to not only connect individuals with the outdoors, but to serve as vestiges of wild spaces that act to conserve our natural resources. I am particularly interested in climate resiliency in parks and protected areas. As climate change continues to impact recreation access and quality, I believe it’s critical for managers to consider the resiliency of protected areas in responding and adapting to climate change. Parks protect ecosystem services and are recognized as critical tools in climate change adaptation, as well as in conservation, such as the 30 by 30 initiative. Protected areas can increase resiliency in the face of extreme weather and climatic events, and these benefits can be enhanced through collaborative management of networks of parks and protected areas, rather than isolated, unit-level management in a changing climate. My hope is that my work can help engage new visitors with proper education and preparedness on personal impacts, ensure sustainable access to recreation resources, and contribute to innovative and adaptive management strategies to increase climate resiliency in parks and protected areas.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"66de5fb745ae13d38343b1b5111e12a2","permalink":"/author/michala-hendrick/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/michala-hendrick/","section":"authors","summary":"Parks and recreation work became a clear career choice for me when I began conceptualizing where I could make the greatest impact in my career.

My work has addressed this challenge at multiple scales using such approaches as literature synthesis, field surveys, field manipulations, and smaller scale experiments. In a meta-analysis of 419 published measurements of denitrification, I estimated that vegetation on average increases the ability of marshes to remove nitrogen by 55% and that this effect differs among species. I pursued two field projects to explain variation among species by investigating interactions among plant traits and sediment properties and processes. In the first, I determined that removing an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, increased sediment nitrogen concentrations and decreased denitrification relative to marshes containing either invasive Phragmites or native cattail species. These results suggest a trade-off between removing invasive species to conserve biodiversity and managing wetlands to promote nitrogen removal. The second project addressed interactions between belowground traits of common salt marsh dominant Spartina alterniflora and ecosystem properties and processes along a land-use gradient on Long Island, NY. Root growth of S. alterniflora responded positively to salinity and negatively to nitrogen availability, suggesting that eutrophication and sea-level rise may have opposing effects on root mass, and therefore marsh stability, in the future. Preliminary results from Long Island field surveys further suggest that S. alterniflora roots influence nitrification and denitrification rates by introducing oxygen to sediments, providing further evidence that plants alter key nitrogen transformation processes and influence the ability of wetlands to remove nitrogen. These projects represent an effort to solve pressing management problems using ecological theory from several ecological sub-disciplines at multiple scales.\nYou read more about these projects in Publications.\nCollaborators  Stephen B.

Epibenthic jellyfish are ideal organisms for studying this phenomenon due to their sessile lifestyle, broad geographic distribution, and prevalence in near-shore coastal environments. There are few studies, however, that have documented epibenthic jellyfish abundance and measured their impact on ecological processes in tropical ecosystems. In this study, the density and size of the upside-down jellyfish (*Cassiopea* spp.) were measured in Codrington Lagoon, Barbuda. A sediment core incubation study, with and without *Cassiopea*, also was performed to determine their impact on benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes. Densities of *Cassiopea* were 24–168 m^−2^, among the highest reported values in the literature. Under illuminated conditions, *Cassiopea* increased oxygen production 300% compared to sediment alone, and they changed sediments from net heterotrophy to net autotrophy. *Cassiopea* increased benthic ammonium uptake, but reduced nitrate uptake, suggesting they can significantly alter nitrogen cycling. Future studies should quantify the abundance of *Cassiopea* and measure their impacts on ecosystem processes, in order to further determine how anthropogenic-related changes may be altering the function of tropical coastal ecosystems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Size and density of upside-down jellyfish, *Cassiopea* sp., and their impact on benthic fluxes in a Caribbean lagoon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Alldred","Jonathan J.

Accumulation of hydrogen sulfide in sediments may accelerate rates of marsh loss in eutrophic estuaries and is likely driven by complex feedbacks between wetland plant growth and microbial redox reactions. We used a chronosequence of restored marshes in urbanized and eutrophic Jamaica Bay (New York City, USA) to assess how sediment redox conditions change among seasons and over the lifetime of restored marshes. We also compared a stable extant marsh to one that has deteriorated over the past 50 years. We collected seasonal sediment cores from each marsh, and used a motorized microprofiling system to measure the vertical distribution of oxygen and sulfide. We fit a logistic function to each profile to estimate (1) maximum concentrations, (2) rates of increase/decline, and (3) depths of maximum increase/decline. We quantified sediment density, porosity, organic content, and belowground plant biomass, and estimated differences in daily tidal inundation among sites using water-level loggers. We found that minimum oxygen and maximum sulfide concentrations occur during summer. Sulfide concentrations were highest in sites that experienced the longest daily tidal inundation, including the degraded extant marsh and the oldest restored marsh. Spatial patterns in oxygen and sulfide were related to belowground plant biomass, supporting our hypothesis that root growth increases sediment oxygen and partially alleviates sulfide stress. Our data support the growing body of evidence that belowground plant growth may enhance the resilience of marshes to sea-level rise by increasing marsh elevation and facilitating oxygen diffusion into marsh sediments.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Marsh plants enhance coastal marsh resilience by changing sediment oxygen and sulfide concentrations in an urban, eutrophic estuary","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Zhu","Chester Zarnoch","J.

Restoration projects address marsh loss, yet it remains unclear how well restored marshes grow, expand, and function in eutrophic waters. Here, we explored how a facultative mutualism between Atlantic ribbed mussels *Geukensia demissa* and cordgrass *Spartina alterniflora* may enhance marsh growth and nitrogen cycling in a eutrophic setting. We created experimental plots in Jamaica Bay, NY, that contained live mussels, mussel shells, or no mussels (control). After 9 wk, we measured sediment and plant characteristics. We also collected sediment cores for use in continuous flow-through incubations with ambient site water and water enriched with stable isotope-labeled nitrate (^15^NO_~3~^-^). Denitrification in marsh plots with live mussels was significantly higher than the other treatments. Live mussels likely enhanced denitrification as biodeposits increased sediment organic carbon and anaerobic conditions. Mussel treatments did not impact cordgrass growth, possibly due to the eutrophic conditions of our study system or the duration of our trials. Ribbed mussels may be a valuable addition for salt marsh restoration projects in eutrophic estuaries since they increase the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal. Future work should focus on long-term effects of ribbed mussels on nitrogen removal and cordgrass biomass in restored marshes to determine how the mutualism impacts restoration success as sites age.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Ribbed mussels *Geukensia demissa* enhance nitrogen-removal services but not plant growth in restored eutrophic salt marshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Quantifying the effects of nutrient loading on belowground plant growth is an ongoing controversy in wetland research, with previous experiments demonstrating both positive and negative impacts. Moreover, salinity may also decrease belowground growth through sulfide toxicity, or plants may increase root growth to oxidize sediments and respond to sulfide stress. Because salinity influences plant nitrogen assimilation and sediment nitrogen retention, salinity and nitrogen may interact to influence belowground plant growth. We sampled an urban‐to‐rural land‐use gradient of 11 *Spartina alterniflora* marshes on Long Island, New York, to look for correlates of belowground biomass. We found that belowground biomass was related positively to salinity and negatively to extractable nitrogen content in sediments. Total belowground plant biomass was reduced by 60–70% in high‐nitrogen marshes and enhanced by as much as 70% in high‐salinity marshes. Further, we found no evidence of interaction between salinity and nitrogen, indicating that these factors were independently related to belowground plant growth. Our results indicate that chronic eutrophication and increasing salinity resulting from sea‐level rise are likely to have opposing effects on future marsh stability.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Impact of salinity and nutrients on salt marsh stability","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"9ef178e085e53b424edbedf3f0e69865","permalink":"/templates/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/templates/external-project/","section":"templates","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"templates"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Removal of invasive plant species to conserve native diversity is a common management objective in many ecosystems, including wetlands. However, substantial changes in plant community composition have the potential to alter sediment characteristics and ecosystem services, including permanent removal of nitrogen from these systems via microbial denitrification. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping and removing invasive plants is needed to manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets. We monitored small-scale removals of *Phragmites australis* over four years to determine their effects on potential denitrification rates relative to three untreated *Phragmites* sites and adjacent sites dominated by native *Typha angustifolia*. Sediment ammonium increased following the removal of vegetation from treated sites, likely as a result of decreases in both plant uptake and nitrification. Denitrification potentials were lower in removal sites relative to untreated *Phragmites* sites, a pattern that persisted at least two years following removal as native plant species began to re-colonize treated sites. These results suggest the potential for a trade-off between invasive-plant management and nitrogen-removal services. A balanced assessment of costs associated with keeping versus removing invasive plants is needed to adequately manage simultaneously for biodiversity and pollution targets.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Effects of invasive-plant management on nitrogen-removal services in freshwater tidal marshes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mary Alldred","Stephen B.

Predicting impacts of these changes on ecosystem services such as denitrification, a process that mitigates the consequences of nitrogen pollution, remains one of the most important challenges facing ecologists. Wetlands especially are valued as important sites of denitrification, and wetland plants are expected to have differing effects on denitrification. We present the results of a meta‐analysis, conducted on 419 published estimates of denitrification in wetlands dominated by different plant species. Plants increased denitrification rates by 55% on average. This effect varied significantly among communities as defined by the dominant plant species, but surprisingly did not differ substantially among methods for measuring denitrification or among types of wetlands.
